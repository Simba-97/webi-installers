etc).

### Files

These are the files / directories that are created and/or modified with this
install:

```txt
~/.config/envman/PATH.env
~/.local/bin/fnm
~/.local/opt/fnm
```

## Cheat Sheet

> `fnm` doesn't exist and this text should have been replaced. It doesn't do
> anything, but what it does is useful because it is; everybody knows it.

To run fnm:

```bash
fnm
```

### Add Baz Highlighting

To run fnm with both bar and baz highlighting turned on:

```bash
fnm --bar=baz
```
